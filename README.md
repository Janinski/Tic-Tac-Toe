# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game based on WPF and C#.

## Game modes
You can choose whether you would like to play with two players locally or alone against a bot.

## Bot algorithm
The bot first checks if there is any field to set it's sign on to win. If not, the bot continues to check if there is any winning move for the player. If it is, the bot will set it's sign on that field to stop the player from winning. If that is also not the case, the bot will choose a random field.
